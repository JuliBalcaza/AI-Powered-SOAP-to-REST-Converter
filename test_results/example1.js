/* SOAP Protocols File: /path/to/file/getXmlTwoFactor.js
 * SOAP protocol found at 'xmlTwoFactor' variable inside 'getXmlTwoFactor' function
 *
 * This SOAP request is being used for Two Factor Authentication. It takes four parameters:
 * idClient, idChannel, idUser, and mto then wrap it in the soap request
 * 
 * Transformation:
 * The function provided below demonstrates how to transform the getXmlTwoFactor SOAP protocol into a more RESTful approach.
 * The parameters go into the path of the URL instead of being wrapped in XML.
 * Specifying .json sends a signal to the server to respond with JSON, the preferred REST format
 * The parameters of the service are passed through the URL itself, instead of enveloped within the body of the request.
 * */
 
const getRestTwoFactor = (idClient, idChannel, idUser, mto) => {
  const url = `/twoFactor/${idClient}/${idChannel}/${idUser}/${mto}.json`;

  fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch((error) => console.error('Error:', error));
};
export default { getRestTwoFactor };

/*
 * Please note that this is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle
 * - proper error handling, timeouts,
 * - potential issues with CORS if this is a cross-origin request,
 * - appropriate headers such as an API key if needed,
 * - response verification to ensure the API returned a successful response, 
 * - as well as possibly asynchronous operations by using async/await or similar.
